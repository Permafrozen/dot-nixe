# dot-nixe
dot-nixe is (will be) my nixos configuration, which is based around `home-manager` and `flakes`. I will daily drive this configuration so I hope I don't abondon it. If you are wondering why I am writing this (I am talking to myself since nobody is reading this shitty ass `README.md` I am writing rn), I guess have not other stuff to do right now.
